    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Eggs are my favorite food ever, so I’ve spent a lot of time perfecting the best omelette recipe. If ever there was an ideal healthy breakfast, this would be it. Not only is this fluffy omelette incredibly healthy (hello veggies, healthy fats, and protein!), but it’s endlessly customizable depending on what veggies are in season, what you like, or what’s in your fridge.

        I’ll show you how to make an omelette, complete with tips and tricks for the fluffiest results every time, and even a formula to use any fillings you want. Enjoy it with a steaming cup of bulletproof coffee or a spinach smoothie, and maybe some bacon.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs – Most omelette recipes are made with 2-3 eggs per serving. This recipe serves two, so we’re using 4 eggs. You can scale it up to make a 3-egg omelette, but any more than 4 eggs per omelette gets hard to handle without falling apart.</li>
        <li>Milk Or Cream – Traditional French omelettes have no milk at all, but an American omelet usually includes it. I used whole milk, but you can also use heavy cream or half and half for more richness, 2% milk for less calories, or almond milk or coconut milk for dairy-free options.</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper – I used 1/8 teaspoon salt per serving of 2 eggs, which is generally the minimum. Use 1/4 teaspoon if you love salt. You can also just eyeball a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Fillings – I used a mix of vegetables this time: Onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, and tomatoes, plus I added avocado on top. (If you like warm avocado, try my baked avocado eggs.) Other veggies (such as asparagus, broccoli, shishito peppers, kale, zucchini, or even leftover eggplant caponata) or cooked meats (such as cooked bacon, ham, sausage, or chorizo) work great, too. You can customize your omelette recipe to your liking. See ideas for filling combinations (and the perfect amount of filling) below.</li>
        <li>Cheese – I used cheddar cheese, but use any kind you like! Mozzarella, feta, goat cheese, or pepper jack cheese tastes great in virtually any omelette recipe. You can also omit the cheese for a dairy free option.</li>
        <li>Oil – For sauteing the fillings and cooking the eggs. Any neutral cooking oil will work here, but I used avocado oil. Butter would also work for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>Fresh Herbs – Not required, but they make a flavorful garnish on top, or you can fold them into the filling. I used some fresh basil leaves for mine, but parsley or chives are also excellent choices.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the eggs, milk, and seasonings. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk or cream, salt and pepper, until the whites and yolks are fully blended and the mixture is a little frothy. Set the whisked eggs aside to rest while you cook the fillings.</li>
        <li>Cook the fillings. Heat avocado oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the vegetables (or meats, if using). Saute until they are soft and lightly browned, and any moisture has evaporated. Transfer the veggies to a plate and cover to keep warm. Wipe any veggie remnants from the pan.</li>
        <li>Cook the eggs. Add more oil to the skillet, tilting to coat. Increase heat to medium-high. Whisk the eggs again to make them foamy, then pour half of the egg mixture into the skillet.</li>
        <li>The uncooked egg will hit the surface of the pan, and you’ll make folds in the eggs, which will make them more fluffy. Repeat this process until the omelette recipe is just barely set.</li>
        <li>Add the fillings. Turn off the heat just before the eggs fully set. Place the cooked veggies over half of the omelette and sprinkle shredded cheese over them.</li>
        <li>Cover. Fold the other half on top and press gently. Cover with a lid, with the heat off, until the eggs are completely cooked through and the cheese should melt.</li>
        <li>Remove. Slide a turner or spatula underneath the omelette to release, if necessary. Tilt the pan to slide it onto a plate. If desired, fan avocado over it or sprinkle with fresh herbs.</li>
        <li>Repeat. Follow the omelette recipe again for the 2nd omelette.</li>
    </ol>
